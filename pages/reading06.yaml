    **Everyone**:

    Last week, we discussed how to utilize [locks] and [condition variables] to
    synchronize multiple [threads] and to construct [concurrent data
    structures].  Though tricky, we saw that there were some common programming
    patterns that allow us to implement [monitor] style [mutual exclusion].

    The readings this week focus on a new synchronization primitive called a
    [semaphore] and on how to use it build [concurrent data structures].

    #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to read about [semaphores] and submit
    your responses to the [Reading 06 Quiz].

    ## Program

    In [Reading 05], you created a [thread] to compute the [sha1sum] of each
    argument.  This provides concurrency and parallelism, but it is possible to
    overwhelm the system and waste time if there are a lot of arguments (and
    thus a lot of threads).  Instead of creating [threads] on-demand, we will
    instead use a [thread pool] to create `2` workers then feed them work via
    the concurrent [queue] discussed in [Lecture 10].

    In summary, you are to modify the program in [Reading 05] to use the
    [producer consumer] model where there are `2` consumers threads (ie.
    `sha1sum_thread`) and `1` producer thread (ie. `main`).

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

    **Note**: You will want to copy the `queue.h`, `queue.c`, and `thread.h`
      files from the [Lecture 10] [queue] example.  Additionally, you will need
      to modify the `Queue` to support storing [c-string]s (ie. `char *`)
      instead of `int`s.

      You may choose between either `queue2.c` or `queue3.c`.

    </div>

    ### Example

    The usage and output of your program should be the same as [sha1sum]:

        :::bash
        $ ./program Makefile  # Compute SHA1 of Makefile
        50bb7f7ccf1ca089f3c5eaff5fe95e56ddbe53a5  Makefile

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        0

        $ ./program asdf      # Handle invalid files

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        1

    ### Requirements

    - Your code must compile cleanly with no warnings.

    - Your program may only use I/O system calls such as [open], [read], and
      [close] to access the contents of each file.

    - Your program must use [stat] to get the size of any files.

    - Your program must use the `SHA1()` function provided by [OpenSSL].

    - Your program must not have any resource leaks or memory errors as
      detected by [valgrind].

    - Your program must use `Thread`, `thread_create`, `thread_join` from
      `thread.h` discussed in [Lecture 10].

    - Your program must use `Queue`, `queue_create`, `queue_push`, `queue_pop`,
      and `queue_delete` from `queue.h` discussed in [Lecture 10].

    - Each thread must run concurrently (ie. without waiting for another
      thread to complete first).

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">

    **Note**: To link properly to the [SHA1] functions, you will need to add
      `-lcrypto` to the `LIBS` variable in your `Makefile`.  You will also need
      to add the `-pthread` flag to your `CFLAGS`.

      Make sure your `program` links with `queue.c` in addition to `program.c`.

    </div>

    ### Hints

    You can define the following constants to make your life easier:

        :::c
        #define MAX_THREADS 2                 /* Number of threads in thread pool */
        #define QSIZE       4                 /* Maximum size of Queue structure */
        #define SENTINEL    (const char *)-1  /* Sentinel to mark end of Queue */

    You will need to modify your `sha1sum_thread` from [Reading 05] into the
    following structure:

        :::c
        void *sha1sum_thread(void *arg) {
            Queue *q = (Queue *)arg;
            ...
            while (...) {
                path = queue_pop(q);
                ...

                if (sha1sum_file(path, cksum)) {
                    ...
                } else {
                    ...
                }
            }
            ...
            return (void *)failures;
        }

    This [thread] function will repeatedly pop from the `Queue` until it
    reaches a `SENTINEL` value.  For each value popped from the `Queue`, the
    [thread] should compute the [sha1sum] of the `path` and track if there are
    any failures.  At the end, the [thread] should return the number of failed
    [sha1sum] computations.

    To implement the [thread pool] pattern, you will need to modify your `main`
    function to look like the following:

        :::text
        function main():
            Thread thread[MAX_THREAD]  # Thread array
            Queue *q = queue_create(SENTINEL, QSIZE)

            # Start thread pool
            For each thread:
                Create a thread stored in thread[i] that runs sha1sum_thread on q.

            # Producer: send work to queue
            For each argument:
                Push argument into q
                
            Push SENTINEL into q

            # Clean up thread pool
            For each thread:
                Join thread[i] and aggregate failures.
